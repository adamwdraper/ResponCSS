# ResponCSS

A fluid, responsive CSS layout framework to help free your web apps from the tyranny of pixel "perfection". With the addition of just a few classes, ResponCSS creates a dynamic set of columns so that the entire flow of a page can adapt to take full advantage of the available screen real estate. The main goal is to give designers and developers a responsive foundation so they can move away from the inflexibility (not to mention cross browser headaches) of pixel driven layouts, and use that extra time to focus on what really matters... the user.

## Columns

As stated above the number of columns changes depending on screen.  This table shows the default settings for ResponCSS.

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Screens</th>
        <th>Class Prefix</th>
        <th>Target</th>
        <th>Layout width</th>
        <th>Columns</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Small</td>
        <td>.s-</td>
        <td>Smartphones and Portrait Tablets</td>
        <td>767px and below</td>
        <td>4</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Medium</td>
        <td>.m-</td>
        <td>Landscape Tablets</td>
        <td>768px to 979px</td>
        <td>8</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Large</td>
        <td>.l-</td>
        <td>Average Desktops</td>
        <td>980px to 1209px</td>
        <td>12</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Xtra Large</td>
        <td>.xl-</td>
        <td>Large Display Desktops</td>
        <td>1210px and up</td>
        <td>16</td>
    </tr>
</table>

## Components
### Containers | .s-1, .m-6, l-9, .xl-15
Containers are designed to be high level parents in your layout. They can be assigned to span a different number of columns for each screen size.

#### Center | .center
Simply add the class ".center" to center a container.

#### Shortcuts | .qtr, .half, .s-qtr3, .xl-full   
If you know you want a container to span the distance across all screen sizes, you can use one of these shortcuts without assigning a size.

#### Overs | .s-over-2, .over-half
Want to push some containers around? That's what overs are for.


## Block Grids | .s-g-1, .g-6
Block grids are designed to be used when you want a certain number of items per row.  The blocks are floated left and will flow into a grid pattern.  Block grids are available in 1 - 10 blocks per row.

## Visibility | .s-hide, .l-show
Visibility can be adjusted per screen size by using "-hide" and "-show" along with a screen prefix.
